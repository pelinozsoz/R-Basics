## 📚What is R?
R software is created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in the Department of Statistics at the University of Auckland in 1991. (Peng, 2022)

R is an interpreted, open-source programming language widely used for statistical computing, data analysis, and visualization.
- Interpreted programming languages are the ones which executed line by line so that enables to observe results immediately.
- They are easy to test, debug and interact with.

In Stages in the Evolution of S, John Chambers writes:

“[W]e wanted users to be able to begin in an interactive environment, where they did not consciously think of themselves as programming. Then as their needs became clearer and their sophistication increased, they should be able to slide gradually into programming, when the language and system aspects would become more important.” (Peng, 2022)

It provides a structared and efficient approach to data manipulation and includes a wide range of powerful libraries.
- A library, package in other words, is a collection of code or datasets provided by others that extends the functionality of the R system.
- Examples: ggplot2, dplyr, Bioconductor, etc.

## 📘Design of the R System
The base R system can be accessed through the "Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)" which also hosts thousands of additional user-contributed packages extending R's functionality.

Conceptually, the R system contains two main parts:
- *The "base" R system* which is directly downloaded from CRAN and includes fundamental components required to run codes on R.
- *Other packages and extentions* which further extends R's performance. R is supported by not only over 10000 packages available on CRAN but also packages created by users and available on personal websites such as GitHub.

There are also many packages available related with the "Bioconductor Project" which is basically specialized to bioinformatics and involves a collecition of packages and tools for analyzing biological and genomic data.
